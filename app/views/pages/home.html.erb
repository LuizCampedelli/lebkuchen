   <h3>The Story Behind the Delicious Rodgau Lebkuchens</h3>
   <p>Rodgau's history began when two friends, Matthias Stark and Michael Rie√ü, had a <br>conversation over good beer and wine.<br>
      They considered starting a business in the baking industry and came up with the<br>
      idea of producing Lebkuchen, a popular seasonal treat in Germany. Matthias is a<br>
       former baker and a passionate hobby baker, who was frustrated with the mass-<br>
       produced Lebkuchen that didn't meet his high standards. The two friends, along<br>
       with Thomas Titt, started baking for personal use but soon the demand for their<br>
       high-quality Lebkuchen exceeded their capacity. They eventually found a bakery<br>
       to work in as semi-professional bakers and after several successful seasons,<br>
       they registered their business with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.<br>
       Today, their team of five bakes a variety of Mandellebkuchen and<br>
       Haselnusslebkuchen, made with fine ingredients and baked to perfection. </p>
