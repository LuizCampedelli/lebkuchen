   ourlebkuchen: "Our Lebkuchen"
   lebkuchen: "Our Lebkuchen is a truly unique product, made without any artificial additives or chemicals. It is purely natural, and we take great care to ensure that it stays that way.
      This means that our Lebkuchen is not only free from harmful chemicals but also full of authentic flavor and texture. Additionally, it is handcrafted, giving it a unique and artisanal look that sets it apart from mass- produced products.
      Each cookie is shaped and finished by hand, resulting in a product that is not only delicious but also visually distinct. This approach also means that each cookie may have slight variations in size or shape, but this only adds to its charm and authenticity."


   history: "Rodgau's history began when two friends, Matthias Stark and Michael Rie√ü, had a conversation over good beer and wine and decided to start a business in the baking industry producing Lebkuchen. Matthias,a former baker and passionate hobbyist, was frustrated with mass-produced Lebkuchen that didn't meet his high standards. They started producing for personal use, but soon the demand for their high-quality Lebkuchen exceeded their capacity. Today, the team of five people produces a variety of Mandellebkuchen and Haselnusslebkuchen made with fine ingredients and baked to perfection."
